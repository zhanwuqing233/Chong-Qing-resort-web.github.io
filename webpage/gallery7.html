            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p id="a">Chongqing Huguang Guild Hall is located at No. 4 Dongshuimen Main Street, Yuzhong District, Chongqing. It was built in the 24th year of Qing Qianlong (1759) and expanded in the 26th year of Daoguang (1846). The hall covers an area of 8561 square meters, including Huguang Hall (also known as Sanchu Hall), Guangdong Hall, Qi 'an Hall (also known as Huangzhou Hall), Jiangxi Hall and Jiangnan Hall.
                During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, due to the unique traffic advantages and geographical conditions of the Yangtze River, the eight provinces thoroughfares and merchants gathered here. Huguang Guild Hall is the historical witness of Chongqing as a bustling commercial port in Qing Dynasty, and also an important symbol of Chongqing's immigration culture, commercial culture and architectural culture from the early Qing Dynasty to the early Republic of China.
                Huguang Guild Hall is a representative of the southern architectural art of the Ming and Qing Dynasties in China, and it is also the largest existing ancient guild hall complex in China.
                In 2000, Chongqing Huguang Guild Hall was listed as Chongqing municipal cultural relics protection unit. In 2006, it was listed as the sixth batch of national key cultural relics protection units.
