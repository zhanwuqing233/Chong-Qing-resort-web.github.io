            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Liziba Park, also known as Liziba Anti-Japanese War Site Park,
                 is located next to Liziba Monorail Station in Yuzhong District
                  of Chongqing, backed by Eiling and north of Jialing River, with
                   a total length of 1.8 kilometers and an area of 120,000 square
                    meters. It is the first Anti-Japanese War site park in Chongqing.
                In 1938, Chongqing gained worldwide fame as a wartime secondary capital.
                 Today, walking in the traditional style area of Liziba, you can also touch
                  the many remaining relics of the Anti-Japanese War, which are the witnesses
                   of the political, economic, cultural, military, diplomatic, financial and 
                   other aspects of the Anti-Japanese War period, condensed into the historical
                    and cultural light and shadow of the wartime capital.</p>
